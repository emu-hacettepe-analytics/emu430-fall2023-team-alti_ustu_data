There are many known and unknown reasons for this. We have done this study in order to examine and analyse these reasons. We have chosen to observe “Average of”PM10 values of the stations” and “Forest area per km^2”. We aim to determine the relationship between air pollution and forestation rate by using these data. To accomplish this, first we are going to monitorize both data by using plots then we are going to do some correlation analysis. After that, we will find outliners and try to figure out the reasons of them. We might need extra data sets to make a reasonable explanation.\n\n\nData Set\n\nData Set\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Our dataset consists of 3 columns. Provinces, pm10_values and forest area. Provinces are categorical variables representing the geographical location or provinces in Turkey, pm10_values are quantitative variables representing the average PM10 values, a common measure of air quality, higher values indicate higher levels of air pollution and forest_area values are quantitative variables representing the percentage of forest area per square kilometer. It reflects the extent of forest coverage in each province. The distribution of PM10 values across provinces can be visualized using a histogram. This would provide insights into the range and frequency of air pollution levels. The distribution of forest area percentages can be visualized using a histogram as well. This helps understand the variation in forest coverage among provinces. Correlation between PM10 values and forest area can be visually represented with a scatter plot. We can ompare provinces in different regions of Turkey to identify regional patterns in air pollution and forest area. A bar chart or grouped box plot can be useful for such comparisons.We can Rank provinces based on PM10 values and forest area to identify provinces with the highest and lowest values. This can be visualized using bar charts or a dual-axis plot.\nHere is some additional analysis for our project ( we’ll be use provinces further in our analysis) :\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\nWarning: package 'gridExtra' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gridExtra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    combine\n\n# Read data from CSV file\ndata1 &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emu-hacettepe-analytics/emu430-fall2023-team-alti_ustu_data/master/project_data.csv\"\n\nproject_data &lt;- read.csv(data1)\n\n# Data Summary\nsummary_data &lt;- project_data %&gt;% summarise(\n    Avg_PM10 = mean(pm10_values),\n    SD_PM10 = sd(pm10_values),\n    Avg_Forest_Area = mean(forest_area),\n    SD_Forest_Area = sd(forest_area)\n  )\n\n# Histogram of PM10 Values\np1 &lt;- ggplot(project_data, aes(x = pm10_values)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of PM10 Values\",\n       x = \"PM10 Values\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n# Histogram of Forest Area\np2 &lt;- ggplot(project_data, aes(x = forest_area)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"green\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Histogram of Forest Area\",\n       x = \"Forest Area\", y = \"Frequency\")\n\n# Scatter Plot with Regression Line\np3 &lt;- ggplot(project_data, aes(x = pm10_values, y = forest_area)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of PM10 Values Compared to Forest Area\",\n       x = \"PM10 Values\", y = \"Forest Area\")\n\n# Display the plots\ngrid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\ndata1 &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emu-hacettepe-analytics/emu430-fall2023-team-alti_ustu_data/master/project_data.csv\"\n\nsummary_data\n\n  Avg_PM10  SD_PM10 Avg_Forest_Area SD_Forest_Area\n1  55.3358 20.29408        30.71111       19.29693\n\n\nAs you can see, contrary to our expectations, the PM10 values do not decrease as forest area increases. While in some places, the correlation might align with expectations, in most areas, there isn’t a clear inverse relationship. Drawing from some articles, we can explain the reasons as follows:\n\n‘More forest means more pollen.’ Pollens contribute to the increase in PM10 levels. Thus, in cities with abundant forest areas, the rise in PM10 levels is attributed to this factor.\nParticles resulting from forest fires increase PM10 levels. While forest density and forest fires may not follow a linear positive relationship, the likelihood of forest fires increases with forest density, potentially leading to an associated increase in PM10 levels.\n***Emissions from vehicles increase PM10 levels. In a scenario with dense forest areas and heavy traffic, a proportional relationship between PM10 levels and forest area might be inevitable.\nEven if the forest area is not dense, a natural environment less affected by human factors is expected to have lower PM10 levels.”\n\n\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nWarning: package 'readxl' was built under R version 4.3.2\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(scales)\nSys.setlocale(\"LC_ALL\", \"en_US.UTF-8\")\n\n[1] \"LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8;LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8;LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8\"\n\ndata2 &lt;-\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emu-hacettepe-analytics/emu430-fall2023-team-alti_ustu_data/master/bolgelerin_arac_sayilari_2015.csv\"\ndata2_cleaned &lt;- read.csv(data2)\nbölgeler_arac_sayısı &lt;- na.omit(data2_cleaned)\n\ncorelation &lt;- cor.test(bölgeler_arac_sayısı$toplam, bölgeler_arac_sayısı$PM10)\n\nggplot(bölgeler_arac_sayısı, aes(x = toplam, y = PM10)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Bölgeler), vjust = -1, size = 3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(x = \"Araç Sayısı\", y = \"PM10 Değerleri\", \n       title = \"PM10 ve Araç Sayısı Arasındaki İlişki\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Data source: Data Set\nOur dataset is a critical component of our analysis, focusing on the interaction between air pollution and forestation in various provinces across Turkey. It consists of two main variables: average PM10 values, which indicate levels of air pollution, and forest area percentage per square kilometer. These metrics were chosen with care because of their direct relevance to environmental health. The concentration of particulate matter harmful to human health and the ecological system is reflected in PM10, a common measure of air quality. The forest area percentage, on the other hand, emphasizes the extent of forest coverage, which is important for air purification and ecological balance. By applying these variables, our project aims to investigate how forestation may influence air pollution levels in various regions. The primary objective is to discover patterns or correlations that can be used to inform environmental policies and promote a healthier ecosystem. These metrics’ data sources are most likely governmental or environmental monitoring agencies that regularly track air quality and forestation levels, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our analysis.\nWe found our data in TÜİK database, which is the official Turkish Statistical Institute. The database containing our data primarily provides information about the provinces’ life satisfaction Index, which includes 11 dimensions of life, including housing, work life, income and wealth, health, education, environment, safety, involvement in society, access to infrastructure services, social life, and life satisfaction. In a single integrated index structure, it reflects these dimensions, which are represented by 41 indicators.\nYou can find our data set here.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
