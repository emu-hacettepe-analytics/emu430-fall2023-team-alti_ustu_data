There are many known and unknown reasons for this. We have done this study in order to examine and analyse these reasons. We have chosen to observe “Average of”PM10 values of the stations” and “Forest area per km^2”. We aim to determine the relationship between air pollution and forestation rate by using these data. To accomplish this, first we are going to monitorize both data by using plots then we are going to do some correlation analysis. After that, we will find outliners and try to figure out the reasons of them. We might need extra data sets to make a reasonable explanation.\n\n\nData Set\n\nData Set\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Data source: Data Set\nOur dataset is a critical component of our analysis, focusing on the interaction between air pollution and forestation in various provinces across Turkey. It consists of two main variables: average PM10 values, which indicate levels of air pollution, and forest area percentage per square kilometer. These metrics were chosen with care because of their direct relevance to environmental health. The concentration of particulate matter harmful to human health and the ecological system is reflected in PM10, a common measure of air quality. The forest area percentage, on the other hand, emphasizes the extent of forest coverage, which is important for air purification and ecological balance. By applying these variables, our project aims to investigate how forestation may influence air pollution levels in various regions. The primary objective is to discover patterns or correlations that can be used to inform environmental policies and promote a healthier ecosystem. These metrics’ data sources are most likely governmental or environmental monitoring agencies that regularly track air quality and forestation levels, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our analysis.\nWe found our data in TÜİK database, which is the official Turkish Statistical Institute. The database containing our data primarily provides information about the provinces’ life satisfaction Index, which includes 11 dimensions of life, including housing, work life, income and wealth, health, education, environment, safety, involvement in society, access to infrastructure services, social life, and life satisfaction. In a single integrated index structure, it reflects these dimensions, which are represented by 41 indicators.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
